## 📌 What Is A Tier?

**A Tier** is where **great games live**.

These are experiences that:
- Do most things right
- Are easy to recommend
- Leave strong impressions
- Respect the player’s time

> A-Tier games are not legendary —  
> they are **consistently excellent**.

---

## 🧠 The Role of A Tier

A Tier is the **backbone of gaming history**.

Without A Tier:
- S Tier wouldn’t stand out
- Innovation would stall
- Great ideas wouldn’t evolve

This tier is about **refinement**, not revolution.

---

## 🚫 What Keeps a Game Out of S Tier?

A Tier games often fall short in **one key area**:

- Limited mechanical depth
- Short lifespan
- Safe or familiar design
- Weak long-term impact

They shine brightly —  
just not **forever**.

## ✅ Core Traits of A-Tier Games

---

### 🎮 1. Strong, Focused Gameplay

- Mechanics are polished
- Controls feel good
- Systems work as intended

Even if the design isn’t groundbreaking,  
it’s **reliable and satisfying**.

---

### 🎨 2. Clear Artistic Identity

A Tier games know how they want to feel.

but they execute it beautifully.

### 🧩 3. Respectful Design

- Clear goals

Failure teaches.  
Success feels earned.

---

### 🔁 4. Replayability (But Finite)

You’ll replay them:
- To perfect a run

- To enjoy the experience again

But eventually,  
you feel **complete**.

And that’s okay.

| Niche appeal | Not universally engaging |

These don’t hurt quality —  
they limit **legacy**.
