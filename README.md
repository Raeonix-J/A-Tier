## 🏆 Tier Placement

**Final Verdict:**  
# 🟩 **A TIER**

Stylish. Focused. Misunderstood.  
Assassin’s Creed Chronicles is not a failure — it’s a **side-path experiment that succeeded quietly**.

## 📜 What Is This Repo?

This repository exists to answer one question:

> **Why Assassin’s Creed Chronicles deserves more respect than it gets.**

It’s not a mainline Assassin’s Creed.  
And that’s exactly why it works.

---

## 🧭 What Chronicles Actually Is (And Isn’t)

### ❌ It is NOT:
- An open-world RPG
- A parkour playground like Ezio’s trilogy
- A lore-heavy blockbuster

### ✅ It IS:
- A **2.5D stealth-focused Assassin experience**
- A distilled version of Assassin philosophy
- A stylistic and mechanical experiment

Once you accept that — the game clicks.

## 🥷 Stealth-First, Combat-Last Design

Chronicles understands something many AC games forget:

> **Assassins survive by not being seen.**

### Why the stealth works:
- Visibility is a **core mechanic**
- Light, shadows, and depth matter
- Combat is intentionally punishing
- Escape > domination

This isn’t power fantasy Assassin’s Creed.  
This is **discipline fantasy**.

## 🎨 Art Direction: Absolute Carry

Each Chronicle entry is visually distinct:

- 🇨🇳 **China** — Ink-brush minimalism
- 🇮🇳 **India** — Vibrant silhouettes and contrasts
- 🇷🇺 **Russia** — Cold, oppressive industrial tones

The game looks like a **moving concept art book**.

Graphics age.  
**Art direction doesn’t.**

---

## 🧠 Level Design That Rewards Patience

Levels are built like puzzles:
- Multiple paths
- Risk vs reward routes
- Vertical and depth-based navigation

Speedrunners and perfectionists thrive here —  
button mashers don’t.

---

## 📖 Story: Small, Personal, Focused

Chronicles tells **contained Assassin stories**:
- Shao Jun reclaiming her identity
- Arbaaz Mir protecting legacy
- Nikolai Orelov caught between ideologies

No world-ending stakes.  
Just **Assassins doing Assassin things**.

---

## ⚠️ Why It’s Not S-Tier

Chronicles has limits — and that’s okay.

| Limitation | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Short runtime | Limited replay value |
| Niche gameplay | Not for everyone |
| Simple combat | Intentionally restrictive |
| Light modern-day story | Missed potential |

S-Tier demands longevity and broad impact.  
Chronicles stays **deliberately small**.

---

## 🧩 Why It’s Not B-Tier Either

B-Tier implies “forgettable.”

Chronicles is:
- Mechanically intentional
- Visually memorable
- Conceptually confident

That alone earns it **A-Tier**.

## 🧠 Final Verdict

> Assassin’s Creed Chronicles is what happens when a franchise:
> **experiments instead of escalating.**

It won’t convert skeptics.  
But for players who value stealth, atmosphere, and precision —

This is Assassin’s Creed **at its most honest**.

---

## ⭐ TL;DR

If you like:
- Stealth over combat
- Style over scale
- Focused, bite-sized Assassin stories

Then **Assassin’s Creed Chronicles** is an **A-Tier experience**  
that deserved better marketing — not a remake.
