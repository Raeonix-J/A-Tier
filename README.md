## ⚠️ Why It’s Not S-Tier

As magical as it is, Trine 1 has limits.

| Limitation | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Light combat | Can feel repetitive |
| Simple story | Functional, not deep |
| Short length | Leaves you wanting more |

S-Tier requires broader depth and evolution.  
Trine 1 is the **spark**, not the explosion.
