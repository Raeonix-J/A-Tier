## 📜 What Is This Repo?

## 🎮 Design Philosophy: No Mercy, No Excuses

Trackmania Turbo has one rule:

> **If you fail, it was you.**

There is:
- No RNG
- No stat grinding
- No hidden systems

Just:
- Your input
- The track
- The clock

And the clock does not forgive.

## 🧠 Mechanical Excellence

### Why the gameplay is A-Tier:
- Controls are **tight and consistent**
- Physics are predictable and learnable
- Muscle memory is king
- Improvement is measurable

Every millisecond shaved feels **earned**.

This is racing distilled to its purest form.

---

## 😭 Why It Hurts So Much

Let’s be honest.

- One mistake can invalidate a perfect run
- Late-game tracks demand near-flawless execution
- Gold and Trackmaster times are **mentally taxing**
- Repetition is mandatory

This is where many players tap out —  
and that’s completely valid.

---

## 🎯 Focused Vision (No Bloat, No Confusion)

Trackmania Turbo never pretends to be something else.

- No open-world distractions
- No progression padding
- No unnecessary features

Just tracks, speed, and mastery.

That clarity alone pushes it above B Tier.

## ⚠️ Why It’s Not S Tier

Trackmania Turbo stops short of greatness in one key area:

| Limitation | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Extreme perfection demand | Limits accessibility |
| High frustration curve | Emotional burnout |
| Minimal onboarding | New players suffer |
| Narrow appeal | Not for everyone |

S Tier demands excellence **and** longevity for a wide audience.

Turbo is elite — but niche.

## 🧠 Final Verdict

> **Trackmania Turbo is a game that respects your skill

That’s exactly why it belongs in **A Tier**.

## ⭐ TL;DR

If you love:
- Precision

Trackmania Turbo will reward you.

If you don’t?

It will punish you relentlessly.

One clean run is all that matters._ 🥲
